## Shaping Minds, One Fold At a Time 

## About Us
We believe that MindGami could be a way for people to be able to push their negative thoughts and worries onto arts and crafts. 
MindGami models take up to 5-10 minutes to fold.
Along the way, we want to let people feel comfortable to share their worries and challenging times in an environment with people like them brought together by MindGami.
